# Everything in Python is an object, which has attributes and functions. These functions within objects are called methods.

# NUMBERS

# Python has two types of numbers - integers and floats.
# Integers are whole numbers like 0, 1, 2 ...
# Floats are numbers with decimal point like 0.1, 3.2 etc.

# In Python we can use type() to find out what's the type of an object.
